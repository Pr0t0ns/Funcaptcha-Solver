**Class Args/Params Explained** (You don't need to specify anything if you want to test with default arg/param values)
- host [required] --> Website URL you're trying to solve for (Sometimes works without decleration)
- site_key [required] --> Funcaptcha Site Key for the site you're trying to solve for
- ua [optional] --> Custom User-Agent option (More advanced Option for people who know what they're doing for higher quality responses)
- proxy [optional] --> Rotating/Static Proxy Option (Pass in proxy to solve with proxy)
- retries [optional] --> Amount of attempts before giving up (Since my audio solver isn't that accurate you can specify the amount of times to attempt to re-solve a funcaptcha before giving up atm the recommended amt of retries would be 5-6)

**Extra**
Please feel free to make PR's (Pull Request) to help improve code. I will be more than happy to review and commit the code if it's good (No typo pr's please).
(Looking for Unflagged BDA method, Bio method, Improving Audio Recognition)

Extra Credits: useragents (High Audio Quality Dictonary); imvast (providing me with the bda src code even though he didn't make it); tranny & keepitlowkey (AES Encryption method src)

**Notes**
Please don't bully me for formatting I coded this on replit with a chromebook cuz i felt like it ðŸ˜†

If you want to use a new proxy & Session you will need to call the class along with the solve function
Example: Funcap(site_key="").solve() # As you can see im calling the class itself along with the function
